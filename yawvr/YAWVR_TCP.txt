TCP port

first byte: 0x30

2-3-4-5 bytes:   An integer number, the port, you're listening on for the simulator data
6-... bytes: an ASCII string, name of the game


theres a bug in the firmware, it ignores the udp port you sent when you check in on tcp.
It only sends on 28067
The emulator is not ignoring the port number though, so it is working as expected.

Hi
 
DánielHier à 19:09
Zsolt talked to me about the problem you have
For the 2. problem, there is a difference unfortunately with the real simulator, and the emulator
for a real device, you have to send data in this form YS[<Axis1a>]P[<Axis2a>]R[<Axis3a>]B[12]
the simulator will know, that the data is from simsools because of the S after the Y
and the B parameter is the bit range. the sim has to know the bitrange, so it can process the data from simtools
but its a bit different on the emulator
in the emulator, you dont need the S after the Y, instead, you have to tick the "Using SimTools" checkbox, and fill in the bit range under it
For the first problem, im not really sure what you mean.
However, I know, that rotation respond is not supported yet on simtools
I mean, the simulator wont send back its rotation, unless you check in with TCP
 
DánielHier à 19:37
Im working on it though.. there will be a UDP message you have to send before the actual gamedata, and the simu will register you as a game
 
g6r6e6gHier à 19:41
Hi, @Dániel thank youn for responses. So meanwhile I get my device I will use the emulator packet format Y param without B param.
 
DánielHier à 19:42
yeah, and be sure to tick the using simtools check
 
g6r6e6gHier à 19:42
Yes I ticked it
About my cnx pb, you mean I have to connect to emulator in TCP instead of UDP in order to get YawVR orientation data ?
 
DánielHier à 19:43
yes
 
g6r6e6gHier à 19:44
Ok and the packet format I will receive is the same as the format sent by SimTools ?
 
DánielHier à 19:44
what do you mean?
oh
it will be Y[]P[]R[]
 
g6r6e6gHier à 19:44
Ok
 
DánielHier à 19:45
you have to send a specific message on tcp, though.
 
g6r6e6gHier à 19:45
I don't have this protocol spec ...
 
DánielHier à 19:46
yeah, we are pretty lack of documentation, unfortunately
 
g6r6e6gHier à 19:46
I only have the "YAW VR  udp packet to game app" protocol
SY[%1.2hf]SP[%1.2hf]SR[%1.2hf]GY[%1.2hf]GP[%1.2hf]GR[%1.2hf]  (SIMULATOR YAW) (SIMULATOR PITCH) (SIMULATOR ROLL) (GAME YAW) (GAME PITCH) (GAME ROLL)
S1[%0.0hf]S2[%0.0hf]S3[%0.0hf]U[%1.2hf]     (1-2-3 MOTOR SPEED)      (4 BATTERY LEVEL)
 
DánielHier à 19:47
yeah, this will be changed, too i think
well
I dont think a game needs this much data, only the first 3
 
g6r6e6gHier à 19:49
Yes I think so, in my case too, ok could you give me a exchange sample on TCP in order I'm able to get Y, P, R angles ?
 
DánielHier à 19:49
If you want, tomorrow i can send you a new emulator build, where you can set where you want to send the simulator rotation back
the tcp checkin looks like this:
 
g6r6e6gHier à 19:51
For instance I'm able to control the emulator with SimTools, no problem. I just need some protocol infos to connect to emulator and receive Yaw, Pitch, Roll angles and use them to compensate this motion orientation into VR headset orientation

first byte: 0x30

6-... bytes: an ASCII string, name of the game
 
g6r6e6gHier à 19:53
ok I will try to send that on TCP to emulator, I will first make a simple Python tester script
thank you so much, can I disturb you in the future if I need some more help ?
 
DánielHier à 20:00
Of course.

Hi, Im sorry, I just want to say, that theres a bug in the firmware, it ignores the udp port you sent when you check in on tcp.

The emulator is not ignoring the port number though, so it is working as expected.
 
g6r6e6gAujourd’hui à 20:54
Hi @Dániel thank you for these informations. I'm using emulator for instance. I will ask for the UDP port 28067 so it will work in all cases.




g6r6e6g11/10/2019
Hello @Dániel,

I've suceeded to connect to Emulator on TCP port to request checkin on UDP port 28067,
but after the reception of TCP response "1AVAILABLE", the SimTools Output Testing seems disconnected from Emulator so I cannot move anymore the YawVR through SimTools and I do not receive anything on UDP port 28067.

thank you for your help
greg
Step1 : SimTools cnx OK

Step2 : I can move YawVR

Step 3 : my python test script connect to TCP 50020 and request the checkin UDP 28067

Step 4 : I cannot move YawVR anymore, I do not receive anything on my python test script (UDP port 28067)

 
g6r6e6g11/10/2019
Emulator displays : ACTUAL_POS;320.09;000.00;000.00
It does not match to the format Y[]P[]R[] you give me :wink: 
(but I do not receive it for instance)
 
Dániel12/10/2019
Hi
So, the response is for the checkin you send over tcp
it says, that the device is available
you cant control the emulator after connecting -- I will investigate this
for the emulator to send its state, you have to stay connected on tcp
Sorry about the emulator, I havent got time to work on it, but i will make it more developer friendly, and give much more control over it
 
Dániel12/10/2019
Hi!
I made a new version, 
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jfIQfmOaQWeKUpGeiqxrQLrMO3QiVJKy
You can set the ip and port you want the data sent back. you dont need to do any TCP checkin. just listen on an UDP port, set it in the emulator, and control it from simtools
 
g6r6e6g12/10/2019
Waouhh ! great ! thank you @Dániel.
 
Dániel12/10/2019
the signs might be opposite to the physical device.. I have to check.
 
g6r6e6g12/10/2019
Ok I will change on my side when this issue will be fixed.
 
g6r6e6g12/10/2019
oups I have a problem today, emulator does not react anymore to simtools ... previous version like your new version, investigating ...
OK it was SimTools which lost my config ... hum very strange
It works well thank you @Dániel
 
Dániel12/10/2019
Glad to hear
the signs of pitch and rool seems to be opposite to a real device. i'll check this next week
 
g6r6e6g12/10/2019
Yes thank you it s not urgent
I will now inject orientation compensation into OpenVR driver
 
Dániel12/10/2019
so when the device pitch backwards, now its sending positive, but it should be negative

good luck
 
g6r6e6g12/10/2019
yes ok it's same on my side roll (axis2a) is positive on backward. thank you I give you news asap
